Bisects rustc toolchains with rustup

Usage: cargo bisect-rustc [OPTIONS] [-- <COMMAND_ARGS>...]

Arguments:
  [COMMAND_ARGS]...
          Arguments to pass to cargo or the file specified by --script during tests

Options:
  -a, --alt
          Download the alt build instead of normal build

      --access <ACCESS>
          How to access Rust git repository
          
          [default: github]
          [possible values: checkout, github]

      --by-commit
          Bisect via commit artifacts

  -c, --component <COMPONENTS>
          additional components to install

      --end <END>
          Right bound for search (*with* regression). You can use a date (YYYY-MM-DD), git tag name
          (e.g. 1.58.0) or git commit SHA.

      --force-install
          Force installation over existing artifacts

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

      --host <HOST>
          Host triple for the compiler
          
          [default: [..]]

      --install <INSTALL>
          Install the given artifact

      --preserve
          Preserve the downloaded artifacts

      --preserve-target
          Preserve the target directory used for builds

      --prompt
          Manually evaluate for regression with prompts

      --regress <REGRESS>
          Custom regression definition
          
          [default: error]

          Possible values:
          - error:     Marks test outcome as `Regressed` if and only if the `rustc` process reports
            a non-success status. This corresponds to when `rustc` has an internal compiler error
            (ICE) or when it detects an error in the input program. This covers the most common use
            case for `cargo-bisect-rustc` and is thus the default setting
          - success:   Marks test outcome as `Regressed` if and only if the `rustc` process reports
            a success status. This corresponds to when `rustc` believes it has successfully compiled
            the program. This covers the use case for when you want to bisect to see when a bug was
            fixed
          - ice:       Marks test outcome as `Regressed` if and only if the `rustc` process issues a
            diagnostic indicating that an internal compiler error (ICE) occurred. This covers the
            use case for when you want to bisect to see when an ICE was introduced on a codebase
            that is meant to produce a clean error
          - non-ice:   Marks test outcome as `Regressed` if and only if the `rustc` process does not
            issue a diagnostic indicating that an internal compiler error (ICE) occurred. This
            covers the use case for when you want to bisect to see when an ICE was fixed
          - non-error: Marks test outcome as `Baseline` if and only if the `rustc` process reports
            error status and does not issue any diagnostic indicating that an internal compiler
            error (ICE) occurred. This is the use case if the regression is a case where an
            ill-formed program has stopped being properly rejected by the compiler. (The main
            difference between this case and `success` is the handling of ICE: `success` assumes
            that ICE should be considered baseline; `non-error` assumes ICE should be considered a
            sign of a regression.)

      --script <SCRIPT>
          Script replacement for `cargo build` command

      --start <START>
          Left bound for search (*without* regression). You can use a date (YYYY-MM-DD), git tag
          name (e.g. 1.58.0) or git commit SHA.

  -t, --timeout <TIMEOUT>
          Assume failure after specified number of seconds (for bisecting hangs)

      --target <TARGET>
          Cross-compilation target platform

      --term-new <TERM_NEW>
          Text shown when a test does match the condition requested

      --term-old <TERM_OLD>
          Text shown when a test fails to match the condition requested

      --test-dir <TEST_DIR>
          Root directory for tests
          
          [default: .]

  -v, --verbose...
          

  -V, --version
          Print version

      --with-dev
          Download rustc-dev [default: no download]

      --with-src
          Download rust-src [default: no download]

      --without-cargo
          Do not install cargo [default: install cargo]

Examples:
    Run a fully automatic nightly bisect doing `cargo check`:
    ```
    cargo bisect-rustc --start 2018-07-07 --end 2018-07-30 --test-dir ../my_project/ -- check
    ```

    Run a PR-based bisect with manual prompts after each run doing `cargo build`:
    ```
    cargo bisect-rustc --start 6a1c0637ce44aeea6c60527f4c0e7fb33f2bcd0d /
      --end 866a713258915e6cbb212d135f751a6a8c9e1c0a --test-dir ../my_project/ --prompt -- build
    ```
