  [#340](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/340)

  [#320](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/320)
- Fixed building `cargo-bisect-rustc` itself to avoid unnecessary build-script rebuilds.

  [#318](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/318)

  [#325](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/325)
- Fixed panic with `--by-commit` but no `--start`.
  [#325](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/325)

- ‚ùóÔ∏è Changed the default access method to "github", meaning it will use the GitHub API to fetch commit information instead of using a local git clone. See the [access documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo-bisect-rustc/rust-src-repo.html) for more information.
  [#307](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/307)

  [#308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/308)

## Fixed
- Fixed an issue when attempting to bisect a rollup, but the perf commits have been garbage collected, to display information about the rollup so that you can see which PRs were involved.
  [#298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/298)

## v0.6.7

### Changed
- Updated dependencies.

  [#285](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/285)
- CI artifacts are now downloaded from https://ci-artifacts.rust-lang.org instead of https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rust-lang-ci2 which should help with performance.

  [#280](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/280)

## v0.6.6

  [#256](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/256)
- üéâ Added a new User Guide with more detailed documentation and a set of examples illustrating different ways to use `cargo-bisect-rustc`. The guide is available at <https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo-bisect-rustc/>.
  [#266](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/266)

- Updated dependencies:
  - tokio [#245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/245) [#255](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/255)
  - git2 [#246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/246) [#249](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/249)
  - bumpalo [#250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/250)
  - pbr [#257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/257)
  - tempfile [#260](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/260)

### Fixed

- Fixed bounds checking when `--start` or `--end` is not specified.
  [#243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/243)
- The remote tags are now fetched from the `rust-lang/rust` repo to ensure that tag boundaries (`--start 1.65.0`) work if the tag hasn't been downloaded.
  [#263](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/263)

## v0.6.5

### Changed

- Stack overflow on any thread (not just 'rustc') is treated as an ICE.
  [#194](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/194)
- Clap (the CLI argument processor) has been updated, which may result in some minor CLI output and parsing changes.
  [#225](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/225)
  [#229](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/229)
- The check for the Rust upstream remote in the git repository has been loosened to only scan for `rust-lang/rust` so that non-https remotes like `git@github.com:rust-lang/rust.git` will work.
  [#235](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/235)
- The `--script` option will now look for a script in the current directory (so that it no longer requires the `./` prefix).
  [#236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/236)
  [#238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/238)
- Specifying `--start` without `--end` will default the end to be the current date. Previously it would use the date of whatever nightly is currently installed.
  [#240](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/240)

### Fixed

- Fixed using either `cargo bisect-rustc` (with a space) or `cargo-bisect-rustc` (with a dash).
  [#187](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/187)
- Show the CLI help page if no arguments are passed.
  [#206](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/206)
- The CLI argument validator for `--script` has been removed to allow running scripts on PATH. This also removes the `--host` validator which was not needed.
  [#207](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/207)
- Fixed showing the full chain of errors instead of just the top-level one.
  [#237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/237)

## v0.6.4

### Added

- Added the `--component` option to choose optional components to install.
  [#131](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/131)
- An estimate of the number of steps left to run is now displayed.
  [#178](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/178)

### Changed

  significant noticeable changes.
  [#151](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/151)
  [#152](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/152)
  [#153](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/153)
  [#155](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/155)
  [#156](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/156)
- The `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET` environment variable is now set with the target triple.
  [#159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/159)
- The default release profile now uses stripping and LTO to significantly
  reduce the binary size.
  [#157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/157)
- Bounds with tags like `--start=1.62.0` are now translated to a nightly date
  instead of a master git commit. This allows using tags from releases more
  than 6 months old.
  [#177](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/pull/177)

## v0.6.3

## v0.6.0

### Added

- Support specifying the path to a rust-lang/rust clone at runtime with `RUST_SRC_REPO`

- Use an anonymous remote that always points to rust-lang/rust when refreshing repository
